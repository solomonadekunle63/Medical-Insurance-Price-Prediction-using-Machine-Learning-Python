# Medical-Insurance-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Python

You must have heard some advertisements regarding medical insurance that promises to help financially in case of any medical emergency. One who purchases this type of insurance has to pay premiums monthly and this premium amount varies vastly depending upon various factors.

In this portfolio project, we will try to extract some insights from a dataset that contains details about the background of a person who is purchasing medical insurance along with what amount of premium is charged to those individuals as well using Machine Learning in Python.

#### Importing Libraries and Dataset
Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.
* Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
* Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
* Matplotlib/Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.
